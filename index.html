  <h1>MOEZO GR</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website! I am learning how to host a webpage with GitHub pages. Ciao amore!</p>
  <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/articles/github-pages-via-web-app/happy-ice-cream.gif" />
  <h2>The Future of This Page!</h2>
  <p>I intend to continue learning how to host pages, once I have a firmer grasp of this, I will implement CSS design elements into this page. Right now I have a non-hosted project with CSS and more advanced HTML and Semantic HTML within it. The purpose of this page is to learn the hosting element of Front-End Web/Application design. Once I have completed the JavaScript portions of the Codecademy career path I am learning with I will also deploy JS into this page. </p>
